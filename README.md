written in python, utilizes various online REST services (musicbrainz, last.fm) and open source audio tools (ffmpeg) to automatically identify and label your music collection.

This was a tool I wrote for myself in 2010 to clean up a decade of poorly labeled id3 tags (and play around with wx-python). I have no plans to update it, but if there's people out there still using it and having problems I'd be happy to help.
